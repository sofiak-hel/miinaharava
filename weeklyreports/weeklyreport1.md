# Weekly Report 1

1. What have you done this week?

> I've thought of the topic for my project.

4. What has been unclear or problematic? Please answer this question truthfully,
   as this is something the course assistant may be able to help with.

> Coming up with the topic was difficult and finding the algorithms ended up
> being more difficult. In the end I chose a topic I'm not entirely happy with,
> but it's the best I could come up with at the time. I especially don't like
> that it's one of the example topics.

5. What next?

> Now comes writing the project I guess.
