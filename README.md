# Mine sweeper

This repository contains two Rust projects:  
    - [miinaharava](./miinaharava/), a minesweeper implementation written in Rust, contains both a human-playable binary and a `lib.rs` in order to expose it for an AI to use.
    - [minesweeper-ai](./minesweeper-ai/), an AI that will attempt to play minesweeper using the aforementioned minesweeper implementation. **This project is the relevant project for Tiralabra**, but the other one contains some tests and code coverage as well.
